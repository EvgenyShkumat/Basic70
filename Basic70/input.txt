Divers have joined the continuing search for British broadcaster Michael Mosley after he went missing while on holiday on the Greek island of Symi.
Known for his TV programmes and his Just One Thing podcast which airs on BBC Radio 4, the presenter was last seen on Wednesday.
He had set off on a walk to the centre of the island.
Local police paused the operation late on Thursday, but continued on Friday morning with reinforcements.
The rescue operation is focused on the Pedi area of Symi after a woman said she saw him there on Wednesday, the island's deputy mayor Ilias Chaskas told BBC News.
Taking part in the search, Mr Chaskas said they have "looked everywhere", and will now have "divers looking into the water" with the help of the Hellenic Coast Guard.
Symi's coastguard said about five patrol boats - along with all private and commercial boats near the island - knew about the incident and were searching for Mr Mosley.
"All our patrol boats are searching", the coastguard said.
The search party currently consists of 25 people including police officers, divers, volunteers and firefighters.
A helicopter was deployed from the Greek capital Athens at about 19:00 local time (17:00 BST) as part of the search and is in use this morning.
The operation is also being assisted by drones searching areas that are hard to reach, as well as a police sniffer dog.
Greek police said Mr Mosley left his wife Clare on the beach before setting off on a walk to the centre of the island on Wednesday.
His phone was found where he was staying with his wife, who reported him missing, a police spokesperson told BBC News.
The 67-year-old broadcaster is well known for BBC programmes which also include the series Trust Me, I'm A Doctor and The One Show, as well as ITV's This Morning.
